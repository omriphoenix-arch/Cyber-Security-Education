🔐 EDUCATIONAL PIN BRUTE FORCE SIMULATION
=============================================

⚠️  ETHICAL DISCLAIMER:
This is an EDUCATIONAL SIMULATION ONLY. It demonstrates:
- How brute force attacks work conceptually
- Why they fail against modern security measures  
- What makes good defensive systems

🚫 DO NOT use this knowledge for unauthorized access!
✅ USE this to understand and improve security systems.

This simulates iPhone-like security measures to show why
brute force attacks are ineffective against modern devices.
