# 🚀 Enhanced Standards Alignment System v2.0 - Major Improvements

## ✨ **What Makes v2.0 Significantly Better**

### **🎯 1. Bloom's Taxonomy Integration**
**Before**: Basic standards alignment without cognitive level tracking
**Now**: Complete Bloom's Taxonomy integration with learning progression

```python
class BloomLevel(Enum):
    REMEMBER = "Remember"      # Basic recall
    UNDERSTAND = "Understand"  # Comprehension  
    APPLY = "Apply"           # Use knowledge
    ANALYZE = "Analyze"       # Break down information
    EVALUATE = "Evaluate"     # Judge and critique
    CREATE = "Create"         # Generate new solutions
```

### **📊 2. Professional Assessment Rubrics**
**Before**: Simple assessment method lists
**Now**: 4-level proficiency rubrics for each standard

```python
RubricCriteria(
    criterion_name="Password Creation",
    novice_descriptor="Creates passwords with 4-6 characters",
    developing_descriptor="Creates passwords with 6-8 characters",
    proficient_descriptor="Creates 8+ char passwords, meets requirements", 
    advanced_descriptor="Creates complex passwords, explains benefits"
)
```

### **🌐 3. Cross-Curricular STEM Integration**
**Before**: Isolated cybersecurity content
**Now**: Explicit connections to Math, Science, English, Social Studies

```python
math_connections=[
    "Counting characters and combinations",
    "Modular arithmetic in Caesar ciphers"
],
science_connections=[
    "Scientific method in cipher analysis",
    "Data collection in frequency analysis"
]
```

### **💼 4. Career & Industry Connections**
**Before**: Minimal career relevance
**Now**: Specific career pathways and industry applications

```python
career_connections=[
    "Cryptographer",
    "Information Security Analyst", 
    "Cybersecurity Specialist"
],
industry_applications=[
    "Financial services security",
    "Healthcare data protection"
]
```
