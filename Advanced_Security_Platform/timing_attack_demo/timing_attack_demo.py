Timing Attack Demonstration
==========================
This script demonstrates how to exploit the timing attack vulnerability
in the vulnerable_auth.py system.

The vulnerability is in the password comparison using == instead of 
secrets.compare_digest(), which allows attackers to measure response
times to determine correct password characters.

EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY!
