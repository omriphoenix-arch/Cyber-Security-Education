## üìö What is the Scientific Method?

The **Scientific Method** is a systematic way to ask questions and find answers about the natural world. Scientists (and YOU!) use this process to investigate, experiment, and understand how things work.

### The Steps:
1. **Ask a Question** - What do you want to know?
2. **Do Background Research** - What do others already know?
3. **Form a Hypothesis** - Make an educated guess
4. **Design an Experiment** - Plan how to test your hypothesis
5. **Conduct the Experiment** - Perform your test and collect data
6. **Analyze the Data** - Look for patterns and results
7. **Draw a Conclusion** - What did you learn?
8. **Communicate Results** - Share what you discovered

---

## üéØ Part 1: Understanding the Steps

### Step 1: Ask a Question

A good scientific question is:
- ‚úÖ **Testable** - You can design an experiment to answer it
- ‚úÖ **Specific** - Clear and focused
- ‚úÖ **Measurable** - You can collect data

**Examples:**

‚úÖ Good Questions:
- Does the temperature of water affect how fast sugar dissolves?
- How does the amount of sunlight affect plant growth?
- Which brand of paper towel absorbs the most water?

‚ùå Not Scientific Questions:
- Which color is prettiest? (Opinion, not testable)
- What is the meaning of life? (Too broad, not measurable)
- Is chocolate better than vanilla? (Opinion, subjective)

**Practice:** Circle the good scientific questions:

1. How does music affect plant growth?
2. What is the best video game?
3. Does the size of a parachute affect fall time?
4. Why is the sky blue?
5. Which soccer player is the greatest?

**Your Turn:** Write your own testable scientific question:

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

### Step 2: Background Research

Before you experiment, learn what others have already discovered!

**Where to find information:**
- üìö Books and encyclopedias
- üíª Reliable websites (.gov, .edu, scientific organizations)
- üë®‚Äçüè´ Experts and teachers
- üî¨ Scientific journals
- üé• Educational videos

**What to research:**
- Key vocabulary related to your question
- Similar experiments others have done
- Scientific principles involved
- Safety considerations

**Practice:** For the question "Does the temperature of water affect how fast sugar dissolves?" list 3 things you should research:

1. _______________________________________________________________

2. _______________________________________________________________

3. _______________________________________________________________

---

### Step 3: Form a Hypothesis

A hypothesis is an **educated guess** about what you think will happen and WHY.

**Format:** "If _______ [I do this], then _______ [this will happen] because _______ [scientific reasoning]."

**Examples:**

"If I increase the temperature of the water, then the sugar will dissolve faster because heat gives molecules more energy to move and break apart the sugar crystals."

"If I give a plant more sunlight, then it will grow taller because plants need light for photosynthesis to make food."

**Your Turn:** Write a hypothesis for your scientific question:

If _______________________________________________________________

then _____________________________________________________________

because __________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

---

### Step 4: Design an Experiment

A good experiment has:

**Variables:**
- **Independent Variable** - What YOU change (the thing you're testing)
- **Dependent Variable** - What CHANGES as a result (what you measure)
- **Controlled Variables** - What you KEEP THE SAME (everything else)

**Control Group:**
- A standard for comparison (doesn't receive the treatment)

**Example:** Testing if plant fertilizer helps plants grow

- Independent Variable: Amount of fertilizer
- Dependent Variable: Plant height
- Controlled Variables: Type of plant, amount of water, sunlight, pot size, soil type
- Control Group: Plant with no fertilizer

**Practice:** For the question "Which brand of paper towel absorbs the most water?"

Independent Variable: ____________________________________________

Dependent Variable: ______________________________________________

Controlled Variables (list at least 3):
1. _______________________________________________________________
2. _______________________________________________________________
3. _______________________________________________________________

**Multiple Trials:**
Why run the experiment more than once?
- ‚úÖ Increases accuracy
- ‚úÖ Helps identify errors
- ‚úÖ Makes results more reliable
- ‚úÖ Shows if results are consistent

**Recommended:** At least 3-5 trials

## üß™ Part 2: Sample Experiment Walkthrough

### Question: Does the amount of baking soda affect the size of a chemical reaction?

**Background Research:**
Baking soda (sodium bicarbonate) reacts with vinegar (acetic acid) to produce carbon dioxide gas, water, and sodium acetate. The reaction is:

NaHCO‚ÇÉ + CH‚ÇÉCOOH ‚Üí CO‚ÇÇ + H‚ÇÇO + CH‚ÇÉCOONa

The CO‚ÇÇ gas creates bubbles and fizzing.

**Hypothesis:**
If I increase the amount of baking soda, then the reaction will produce more carbon dioxide gas because there will be more baking soda molecules available to react with the vinegar.

**Materials:**
- Baking soda
- White vinegar (100 mL per trial)
- Measuring spoons
- Balloons (to capture gas)
- Bottles (500 mL)
- Measuring tape or ruler
- Safety goggles

**Procedure:**
1. Put on safety goggles
2. Pour 100 mL of vinegar into bottle
3. Put 1 teaspoon of baking soda into balloon
4. Carefully attach balloon to bottle opening (don't let baking soda fall in yet!)
5. Lift balloon so baking soda falls into vinegar
6. Observe reaction
7. When reaction stops, measure balloon circumference
8. Record data
9. Repeat with 2, 3, 4, and 5 teaspoons of baking soda
10. Run 3 trials for each amount

**Safety Considerations:**
- Wear safety goggles (vinegar can splash)
- Don't point bottle at anyone
- Work in well-ventilated area
- Clean up spills immediately
- Wash hands after experiment

**Data Table:**

| Baking Soda Amount | Trial 1 (cm) | Trial 2 (cm) | Trial 3 (cm) | Average (cm) |
|-------------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|
| 1 teaspoon        | 15           | 16           | 15           | 15.3         |
| 2 teaspoons       | 22           | 23           | 22           | 22.3         |
| 3 teaspoons       | 28           | 27           | 28           | 27.7         |
| 4 teaspoons       | 30           | 31           | 30           | 30.3         |
| 5 teaspoons       | 30           | 30           | 31           | 30.3         |

**Graph:** 
(Create a bar graph or line graph showing baking soda amount vs. balloon circumference)

**Analysis Questions:**

1. What happened as you increased the amount of baking soda?

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

2. Did the balloon keep getting bigger with more baking soda? Why or why not?

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

3. What do you think limited the reaction at higher amounts?

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**Conclusion:**
My hypothesis was partially correct. Increasing the baking soda amount did increase the reaction size, BUT only up to a point. After 4 teaspoons, adding more baking soda didn't make the balloon bigger. This is because there was limited vinegar (100 mL), and once all the vinegar reacted, extra baking soda couldn't react. The vinegar was the **limiting reactant**.

**Further Questions:**
- What would happen if I increased the vinegar amount too?
- Would the reaction speed change with baking soda amount?
- How does temperature affect this reaction?
