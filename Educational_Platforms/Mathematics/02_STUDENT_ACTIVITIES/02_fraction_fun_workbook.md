## 📋 What is a Fraction?

A fraction represents **part of a whole** or **part of a group**.

### The Two Parts of a Fraction:

```
    3  ← Numerator (How many parts we have)
    —
    4  ← Denominator (How many equal parts in the whole)
```

**Read as:** "three-fourths" or "three out of four"

## 🍕 Real-World Fractions

### Example 1: Pizza!
Imagine a pizza cut into 8 equal slices:
- If you eat 3 slices, you ate **3/8** of the pizza
- If 5 slices remain, that's **5/8** of the pizza
- All slices together = **8/8** = 1 whole pizza

### Example 2: Chocolate Bar
A chocolate bar has 12 squares:
- You eat 4 squares = **4/12** of the bar
- Your friend eats 6 squares = **6/12** of the bar
- 2 squares left = **2/12** of the bar

### Example 3: Class
Your class has 24 students:
- 15 are wearing sneakers = **15/24** of the class
- 9 are wearing other shoes = **9/24** of the class

### 1. Show 1/2
Draw a circle. Divide it into **2 equal parts**. Shade **1 part**.

```
Draw your circle here:




```

### 2. Show 2/4
Draw a rectangle. Divide it into **4 equal parts**. Shade **2 parts**.

```
Draw your rectangle here:




```

### 3. Show 3/6
Draw a circle. Divide it into **6 equal parts**. Shade **3 parts**.

```
Draw your circle here:




```

**Reflection Question:**
Do 1/2, 2/4, and 3/6 look the same amount? Why or why not?

## 📏 Activity 2: Fractions on a Number Line

A number line helps us see where fractions fit between 0 and 1.

### Example:
```
0        1/4      1/2      3/4       1
|---------|---------|---------|---------|
```

**Practice:** Mark these fractions on the number lines below:

### 1. Mark 1/3 and 2/3
```
0                                     1
|-------------------------------------|
```

### 2. Mark 1/8, 3/8, 5/8, and 7/8
```
0                                     1
|-------------------------------------|
```

### 3. Mark 2/5 and 4/5
```
0                                     1
|-------------------------------------|
```

## 🎯 Activity 4: Equivalent Fractions

**Equivalent fractions** are different fractions that represent the same amount!

### Example:
```
1/2 = 2/4 = 3/6 = 4/8 = 5/10

All of these show the same amount (half)!
```

### Visual Proof:
```
1/2:   [██████|      ]
2/4:   [███|███|   |   ]  
3/6:   [██|██|██| | | ]

Same amount shaded!
```

**Practice:** Find equivalent fractions by multiplying:

### 1. Find fractions equivalent to 1/3

1/3 = (1×2)/(3×2) = ___/___

1/3 = (1×3)/(3×3) = ___/___

1/3 = (1×4)/(3×4) = ___/___

### 2. Find fractions equivalent to 2/5

2/5 = (2×2)/(5×2) = ___/___

2/5 = (2×3)/(5×3) = ___/___

2/5 = (2×4)/(5×4) = ___/___

### 3. Find fractions equivalent to 3/4

3/4 = ___/8

3/4 = ___/12

3/4 = ___/16

## 📊 Activity 5: Comparing Fractions

### Rule 1: Same Denominator
When denominators are the same, compare numerators:
- 3/8 < 5/8 (because 3 < 5)
- 7/10 > 4/10 (because 7 > 4)

**Practice:** Use <, >, or =

1. 2/6 _____ 4/6

2. 5/8 _____ 3/8

3. 6/10 _____ 9/10

### Rule 2: Same Numerator
When numerators are the same, smaller denominator = larger fraction:
- 1/2 > 1/4 (half is bigger than a fourth)
- 3/5 > 3/8 (fifths are bigger pieces than eighths)

**Think about pizza:** Would you rather have 1/2 or 1/4 of a pizza? The smaller the number of pieces, the bigger each piece!

**Practice:** Use <, >, or =

1. 2/3 _____ 2/5

2. 4/6 _____ 4/8

3. 1/2 _____ 1/3

### Rule 3: Benchmark Fractions
Compare to 1/2:
- Fractions greater than 1/2: 3/4, 5/8, 7/10
- Fractions less than 1/2: 1/4, 2/6, 3/10
- Equal to 1/2: 2/4, 3/6, 5/10

**Practice:** Circle the larger fraction:

1. 3/5  or  2/5

2. 1/3  or  1/2

3. 5/6  or  3/4 (Hint: Convert to same denominator!)
