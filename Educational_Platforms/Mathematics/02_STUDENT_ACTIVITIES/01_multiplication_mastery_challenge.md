3 rows √ó 4 columns = 12 stars
```

## üéì Learning Strategies

### Strategy 1: Skip Counting
Count by the number you're multiplying:

**2s:** 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20...
**5s:** 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50...
**10s:** 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100...

**Practice:**
- Count by 3s to find 3 √ó 8 = _____
- Count by 4s to find 4 √ó 7 = _____

---

### Strategy 2: Use What You Know (Building Up)

If you know **3 √ó 4 = 12**, then:
- **4 √ó 4** = (3 √ó 4) + 4 = 12 + 4 = **16**
- **5 √ó 4** = (4 √ó 4) + 4 = 16 + 4 = **20**

**Practice:**
1. If 5 √ó 6 = 30, what is 6 √ó 6? _____
2. If 7 √ó 8 = 56, what is 8 √ó 8? _____

---

### Strategy 3: Doubles

**Doubles are easy to remember:**
- 2 √ó 2 = 4
- 3 √ó 3 = 9
- 4 √ó 4 = 16
- 5 √ó 5 = 25
- 6 √ó 6 = 36
- 7 √ó 7 = 49
- 8 √ó 8 = 64
- 9 √ó 9 = 81
- 10 √ó 10 = 100
- 11 √ó 11 = 121
- 12 √ó 12 = 144

**Memory Tip:** Create a doubles poster and look at it daily!

---

### Strategy 4: Break Apart (Distributive Property)

Break harder facts into easier ones:

**Example: 7 √ó 8**
- Think: 7 √ó 8 = (5 √ó 8) + (2 √ó 8)
- = 40 + 16
- = **56**

**Practice:**
1. 6 √ó 9 = (5 √ó 9) + (1 √ó 9) = _____ + _____ = _____
2. 8 √ó 7 = (5 √ó 7) + (3 √ó 7) = _____ + _____ = _____

---

### Strategy 5: Commutative Property

**The order doesn't matter!**
- 3 √ó 4 = 4 √ó 3
- 7 √ó 2 = 2 √ó 7

**Why This Helps:**
If you know 3 √ó 8 = 24, you automatically know 8 √ó 3 = 24!
That's **two facts for the price of one!**

2. To multiply 9 √ó 4, put down your 4th finger
3. Count fingers: **3** before, **6** after
4. Answer: **36**!

### 9s Pattern Trick
**Look at the pattern:**
- 9 √ó 1 = 09 (0 + 9 = 9)
- 9 √ó 2 = 18 (1 + 8 = 9)
- 9 √ó 3 = 27 (2 + 7 = 9)
- 9 √ó 4 = 36 (3 + 6 = 9)
- 9 √ó 5 = 45 (4 + 5 = 9)

**The digits always add up to 9!**

### 11s Pattern
- 11 √ó 2 = 22
- 11 √ó 3 = 33
- 11 √ó 4 = 44
- 11 √ó 5 = 55
