# Historical Analysis Student Workbook
## Thinking Like a Historian

---

## üìö Welcome, Young Historians!

History is not just about memorizing dates and names. It's about asking questions, analyzing evidence, and understanding how the past shapes our present. This workbook will help you develop the skills historians use every day!

---

## üîç Part 1: Analyzing Primary Sources

### What is a Primary Source?

**Primary sources** are materials created during the time period you're studying. They give us direct evidence about the past.

**Examples:**
- Letters and diaries
- Photographs
- Government documents
- Speeches
- Artifacts (objects)
- Newspapers from the time
- Art and music

**Secondary sources** are created later by people studying the past.
- History textbooks
- Documentaries
- Biographies
- Museum displays

---

### Activity 1: Source Detective

Look at the items below. Circle **P** for Primary Source or **S** for Secondary Source:

1. A letter written by George Washington in 1776 .............. **P / S**
2. A history book about World War II published in 2020 ......... **P / S**
3. A photograph of the Civil Rights March on Washington in 1963 . **P / S**
4. A documentary about ancient Egypt .......................... **P / S**
5. A diary entry from a pioneer traveling west in 1850 ........ **P / S**
6. Your social studies textbook .............................. **P / S**
7. The original U.S. Constitution ............................. **P / S**
8. A website analyzing the causes of World War I .............. **P / S**
9. A Native American pottery bowl from 800 CE ................. **P / S**
10. An encyclopedia article about Christopher Columbus ......... **P / S**

**Challenge Question:** Why is it important for historians to use primary sources?

### Activity 2: The SOAPS Method

Historians use **SOAPS** to analyze primary sources:

**S = Speaker/Source** - Who created this?  
**O = Occasion** - What was happening when this was created?  
**A = Audience** - Who was this created for?  
**P = Purpose** - Why was this created?  
**S = Subject** - What is this about?

**Let's Practice!**

Read this excerpt from a letter:

> *Dear Mother,*
> 
> *The conditions here at the factory are terrible. We work from sunrise to sunset, and the air is filled with dust from the cotton. Many of the children are becoming sick. The foreman yells at us if we slow down, even for a moment. I am so tired, but we need the money. I hope you and Father are well.*
> 
> *Your daughter, Sarah*
> 
> *March 15, 1835*
> *Lowell, Massachusetts*

**Now analyze using SOAPS:**

**Speaker/Source:** Who wrote this letter?

____________________________________________________________________

**Occasion:** What was happening? (Hint: Think about the date and location)

____________________________________________________________________

____________________________________________________________________

**Audience:** Who was this letter written to?

____________________________________________________________________

**Purpose:** Why did Sarah write this letter?

____________________________________________________________________

____________________________________________________________________

**Subject:** What is the main topic?

____________________________________________________________________

____________________________________________________________________

**What does this source tell you about factory work in the 1830s?**

____________________________________________________________________

____________________________________________________________________

____________________________________________________________________

____________________________________________________________________

### Activity 3: Reading Photographs as Primary Sources

Photographs are powerful primary sources! They show us what people, places, and events looked like. But we have to analyze them carefully.

**Photo Analysis Questions:**

1. **Observe:** What do you see? (People, objects, activities, setting)
2. **Infer:** What can you conclude about what's happening?
3. **Question:** What questions does this photo raise?
4. **Consider:** Who took this photo and why? What might be outside the frame?

**Practice Activity:**

Imagine you're looking at a photograph from the 1960s showing students sitting at a lunch counter. Some students are Black, some are white. White people are standing around them, yelling. Police officers are in the background.

**What do you OBSERVE?**

____________________________________________________________________

____________________________________________________________________

____________________________________________________________________

**What can you INFER about what's happening?**

____________________________________________________________________

____________________________________________________________________

____________________________________________________________________

**What QUESTIONS does this raise?**

____________________________________________________________________

____________________________________________________________________

____________________________________________________________________

**Why might someone have taken this photo?**

____________________________________________________________________

### Activity 4: Analyzing Different Perspectives

History looks different depending on whose perspective you're seeing it from!

**Scenario:** The California Gold Rush (1849)

Read these three perspectives:

**Perspective 1 - James Marshall (discovered gold):**
"I found flakes of gold in the river! This discovery will make California rich and prosperous. Thousands will come seeking fortune!"

**Perspective 2 - Native American (Maidu tribe):**
"Strangers are flooding our land, destroying our fishing sites and sacred places. They take what they want and force us away. Our way of life is ending."

**Perspective 3 - Chinese Immigrant:**
"I came from China seeking the 'Golden Mountain.' Work is hard and Americans treat us poorly, but I send money home to my family. Maybe one day I can return to China wealthy."

**Questions:**

1. **What does each person think about the Gold Rush?**

   Marshall: _________________________________________________________

   Native American: __________________________________________________

   Chinese Immigrant: ________________________________________________

2. **How are their perspectives different?**

____________________________________________________________________

____________________________________________________________________

____________________________________________________________________

3. **Why do they see the same event so differently?**

____________________________________________________________________

____________________________________________________________________

____________________________________________________________________

4. **Whose perspective is usually told in history books? Why?**

____________________________________________________________________

____________________________________________________________________

____________________________________________________________________

5. **Why is it important to learn about all perspectives?**

## üåç Part 2: Geographic Thinking

Geography is more than just knowing where places are. It's about understanding **why** things happen **where** they do!

### The 5 Themes of Geography

1. **Location:** Where is it? (Absolute: coordinates; Relative: near what?)
2. **Place:** What is it like there? (Physical and human characteristics)
3. **Human-Environment Interaction:** How do people affect the environment? How does environment affect people?
4. **Movement:** How do people, goods, and ideas move?
5. **Region:** What makes this area similar? How is it different from other areas?

### Activity 11: Checks and Balances

The three branches of government have powers to check (limit) each other. This prevents any one branch from becoming too powerful.

**Fill in the diagram:**

```
         LEGISLATIVE BRANCH
            (Congress)
              ‚Üô    ‚Üì    ‚Üò
             /     |     \
        Can override  Makes laws   Approves judges
         president's     |         and treaties
           veto          |              |
            |            |              |
            ‚Üì            ‚Üì              ‚Üì
    EXECUTIVE ‚Üê‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî + ‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Üí JUDICIAL
      BRANCH                      BRANCH
   (President)                   (Courts)
            ‚Üì                        ‚Üì
       Enforces laws            Interprets laws
            ‚Üì                        ‚Üì
    Can veto laws              Can declare laws
            ‚Üì                   unconstitutional
```

**Complete the checks:**

1. **Legislative checks on Executive:**
   - Can override veto
   - _______________________________________________________________

2. **Legislative checks on Judicial:**
   - Approves judges
   - _______________________________________________________________

3. **Executive checks on Legislative:**

### Activity 12: Be a Supreme Court Justice

The Supreme Court's job is to interpret the Constitution and decide if laws are constitutional.

**Case Study: Tinker v. Des Moines (1969)**

**Background:** During the Vietnam War, students Mary Beth Tinker and others wore black armbands to school to protest the war. The school suspended them, saying the armbands were disruptive.

**Constitutional Question:** Does the First Amendment (freedom of speech) protect students' right to wear armbands in school?

**Arguments:**

**For the Students:**
- First Amendment protects symbolic speech
- Armbands did not actually disrupt class
- Schools cannot censor student speech just because they disagree with it
- Students don't "shed their constitutional rights at the schoolhouse gate"

**For the School:**
- Schools need to maintain order
- Armbands could be disruptive
- Schools have authority over students
- Other students might be offended

**YOU DECIDE:**

Should students have the right to wear protest armbands in school?

**Your decision:** __________________________________________________

**Your reasoning:** (Use the Constitution and facts from the case)

____________________________________________________________________

____________________________________________________________________

____________________________________________________________________

____________________________________________________________________

____________________________________________________________________

**Actual ruling:** The Supreme Court ruled 7-2 in favor of the students, saying students have First Amendment rights as long as they don't substantially disrupt school.

**Did you agree with the actual ruling? Why or why not?**

____________________________________________________________________

____________________________________________________________________

____________________________________________________________________

## üí∞ Part 4: Economic Thinking

### Activity 13: Scarcity and Choice

**Economics** is about how people make choices about using limited resources.

**Scarcity** means we don't have enough resources to satisfy all our wants.

**Because of scarcity, we have to make choices!**

**Every choice has an opportunity cost** - what you give up when you choose one thing over another.

**Example:**
- You have $10
- You want to buy a book ($10) AND see a movie ($10)
- You can't do both!
- You choose the movie
- **Opportunity cost:** The book you gave up

**Your Turn:**

**Scenario 1:**
You have one hour of free time after school. You could:
- Play video games
- Do homework
- Practice basketball
- Hang out with friends

**What would you choose?** _________________________________________

**What is your opportunity cost?** (What are you giving up?)

____________________________________________________________________

**Scenario 2:**
Your community has $1 million to spend. They could:
- Build a new park
- Repair roads
- Build a new library
- Hire more police officers

**What would you choose?** _________________________________________

**What is the opportunity cost?** _________________________________

____________________________________________________________________

**Why is opportunity cost important?**

____________________________________________________________________

____________________________________________________________________

### Activity 14: Supply and Demand

**Supply:** How much of a product is available

**Demand:** How much people want to buy the product

**Price is determined by supply and demand!**

**Rules:**
- High demand + Low supply = **Prices go UP**
- Low demand + High supply = **Prices go DOWN**

**Practice:**

For each scenario, predict what will happen to price:

1. **New video game console is released. Everyone wants one, but the company didn't make very many.**

   Price will: _________________ (increase / decrease)
   
   Why? _____________________________________________________________

2. **After Halloween, stores have lots of leftover candy. Not many people want to buy it.**

   Price will: _________________ (increase / decrease)
   
   Why? _____________________________________________________________

3. **A drought destroys much of the wheat crop. There's not enough flour to make bread.**

   Price of bread will: _________________ (increase / decrease)
   
   Why? _____________________________________________________________

4. **A new smartphone model comes out. The old model is still available, but everyone wants the new one.**

   Price of old model will: _________________ (increase / decrease)
   
   Why? _____________________________________________________________

**Create Your Own:**

Think of a real-world example of supply and demand:

____________________________________________________________________

____________________________________________________________________

____________________________________________________________________

### Activity 15: Economic Systems

Different societies organize their economies in different ways.

**Traditional Economy:**
- Based on customs and traditions
- People do what their parents did
- Little change
- Example: Farming communities that have done things the same way for centuries

**Command Economy:**
- Government makes all economic decisions
- Government decides what to produce, how much, and the price
- Little individual choice
- Example: North Korea

**Market Economy:**
- Individuals and businesses make decisions
- Supply and demand determine prices
- Competition
- Example: United States (mostly)

**Mixed Economy:**
- Combination of market and command
- Private businesses, but government regulation
- Most modern countries
- Example: United States (actually)

**Compare the Systems:**

|  | Traditional | Command | Market | Mixed |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Who decides what to produce?** | Tradition | Government | Businesses/Consumers | Both |
| **Advantages** | | | | |
| **Disadvantages** | | | | |

**Fill in advantages and disadvantages for each system.**

**Which system do you think is best? Why?**

## üìä Part 5: Historical Thinking Skills

### Activity 16: Cause and Effect

History is full of causes and effects. One event leads to another!

**Sometimes one cause leads to multiple effects:**

Example:
- **Cause:** Printing press invented (1450)
- **Effects:**
  - Books became cheaper
  - More people learned to read
  - Ideas spread faster
  - Protestant Reformation
  - Scientific Revolution

**Sometimes multiple causes lead to one effect:**

Example:
- **Causes:**
  - Industrial Revolution
  - Steam power
  - Need for resources
  - European competition
- **Effect:** European imperialism in Africa and Asia

**Practice:**

**Identify cause and effect:**

1. The Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941. The United States entered World War II.

   **Cause:** _______________________________________________________
   
   **Effect:** ______________________________________________________

2. Because of new farming technology and techniques, farmers could grow more food. The population of cities increased as fewer farmers were needed.

   **Cause:** _______________________________________________________
   
   **Effect:** ______________________________________________________

3. The United States passed laws limiting immigration in the 1920s. Fewer immigrants came to America.

   **Cause:** _______________________________________________________
   
   **Effect:** ______________________________________________________

**Create a Cause and Effect Chain:**

Pick a historical event and trace its causes and effects:

```
Earlier Cause ‚Üí Cause ‚Üí EVENT ‚Üí Effect ‚Üí Later Effect
```

**Example:** Industrial Revolution

```
New inventions ‚Üí People move to cities ‚Üí INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION ‚Üí 
Working conditions poor ‚Üí Labor unions form
```

**Your turn:** (Choose any historical event)

```
______________ ‚Üí ______________ ‚Üí ______________ ‚Üí 
______________ ‚Üí ______________
```

---

### Activity 17: Continuity and Change

Some things change over time. Some things stay the same. Historians look at both!

**Continuity:** What stays the same over time

**Change:** What is different over time

**Example: Transportation in America**

| Time Period | Transportation | What Changed? | What Stayed the Same? |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1800 | Horse, walking, boat | - | Need to move people/goods |
| 1850 | Added trains | Trains faster than horses | Still use horses too |
| 1900 | Added cars | Personal motorized transport | Trains still important |
| 1950 | Added planes | Long-distance air travel | Cars dominant |
| 2000 | All of the above | Technology improved | Multiple options available |

**Your Turn:**

Pick a topic and analyze continuity and change:

**Topic ideas:** Communication, clothing, education, gender roles, entertainment, food

**My Topic:** ______________________________________________________

| Time Period | How It Was | What Changed? | What Stayed the Same? |
|---|---|---|---|
| 100 years ago | | | |
| 50 years ago | | | |
| Today | | | |
| Future (predict!) | | | |

**Reflection:**

**Why do some things change while others stay the same?**

____________________________________________________________________

____________________________________________________________________

### Activity 18: Historical Significance

Not all historical events are equally important. Historians decide which events are **historically significant**.

**An event is historically significant if:**
1. It affected many people
2. It led to important changes
3. It reveals something important about the time period
4. It continues to affect us today

**Practice:** Rate the historical significance

For each event, rate 1-5 (1 = not significant, 5 = very significant) and explain:

1. **George Washington becomes first President**

   Rating: _____ / 5
   
   Why? _____________________________________________________________
   
   __________________________________________________________________

2. **First McDonald's restaurant opens (1940)**

   Rating: _____ / 5
   
   Why? _____________________________________________________________
   
   __________________________________________________________________

3. **World War II ends (1945)**

   Rating: _____ / 5
   
   Why? _____________________________________________________________
   
   __________________________________________________________________

4. **Your favorite celebrity releases a new song**

   Rating: _____ / 5
   
   Why? _____________________________________________________________
   
   __________________________________________________________________

5. **Invention of the internet**

   Rating: _____ / 5
   
   Why? _____________________________________________________________
   
   __________________________________________________________________

**Debate Question:**

**How do we know what's significant at the time vs. looking back later?**

____________________________________________________________________

____________________________________________________________________

____________________________________________________________________

### Activity 19: Historical Empathy

**Historical empathy** means understanding how people in the past thought and felt, even if we disagree with them.

**This does NOT mean approving of everything people did!**

It means trying to understand **why** they thought and acted as they did, given:
- The information they had
- The time they lived in
- Their cultural context
- Their experiences

**Practice:**

**Scenario:** It's 1620. You're a Pilgrim deciding whether to sail to America on the Mayflower.

**What you know:**
- Life is hard in England (religious persecution, poverty)
- The journey is dangerous (many die at sea)
- America is unknown and wilderness
- Native Americans live there (you've heard stories, some scary)
- You want religious freedom
- Your family is coming too

**Questions:**

1. **What would you be thinking about?**

   __________________________________________________________________
   
   __________________________________________________________________

2. **What would you be afraid of?**

   __________________________________________________________________
   
   __________________________________________________________________

3. **What would you be excited about?**

   __________________________________________________________________
   
   __________________________________________________________________

4. **Would you go? Why or why not?**

   __________________________________________________________________
   
   __________________________________________________________________
   
   __________________________________________________________________

5. **How is your perspective different from someone living in 1620?**

   __________________________________________________________________
   
   __________________________________________________________________
   
   __________________________________________________________________

**Reflection:**

**Why is historical empathy important?**

____________________________________________________________________

## üéØ Part 6: Research Skills

### Activity 20: Asking Historical Questions

Good questions lead to good research!

**Types of Questions:**

**Factual:** Can be answered with a simple fact
- Example: When did World War II end?
- Answer: 1945

**Analytical:** Require analysis and explanation
- Example: Why did World War II end in 1945?
- Answer: Multiple factors including...

**The best research questions:**
- Are open-ended (not yes/no)
- Require analysis
- Are focused enough to answer
- Are broad enough to be interesting

**Practice:**

Turn these factual questions into analytical questions:

1. **Factual:** Who was Martin Luther King Jr.?

   **Analytical:** __________________________________________________
   
   __________________________________________________________________

2. **Factual:** When was the Declaration of Independence signed?

   **Analytical:** __________________________________________________
   
   __________________________________________________________________

3. **Factual:** What was the Silk Road?

   **Analytical:** __________________________________________________
   
   __________________________________________________________________

**Create Your Own Research Question:**

Pick a topic that interests you: ____________________________________

**Bad question** (too factual): _____________________________________

**Better question** (analytical): ____________________________________

____________________________________________________________________

**Why is your better question more interesting?**

____________________________________________________________________

____________________________________________________________________

### Activity 21: Evaluating Sources

Not all sources are equally reliable! You need to evaluate them.

**Questions to Ask:**

1. **Who created this?** (Author, organization)
2. **When was it created?** (Recent? From the time period?)
3. **Why was it created?** (Inform? Persuade? Sell something?)
4. **What evidence is provided?** (Facts? Opinions? Sources cited?)
5. **Is this biased?** (One-sided? Fair?)
6. **Can I verify this elsewhere?** (Do other sources confirm this?)
