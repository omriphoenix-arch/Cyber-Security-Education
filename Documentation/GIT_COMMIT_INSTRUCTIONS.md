## Manual Git Commands

Since Git is not currently in your PowerShell PATH, please open **Git Bash** (usually found in Start Menu > Git > Git Bash) and run these commands:

```bash
cd /c/Users/Omri.Morgan02/Downloads/spammer/Cyber-Security-Education

# Add all new folders
git add Mathematics
git add Science
git add Social_Studies

# Check what will be committed
git status

# Commit with descriptive message
git commit -m "Add Mathematics, Science, and Social Studies educational platforms

- Mathematics: Interactive math studio, K-12 lesson plans, student activities
- Science: Physics lab simulation, NGSS-aligned content, scientific method workbook  
- Social Studies: Government & economics simulators, C3 Framework alignment, historical analysis

All platforms include comprehensive teacher resources, student activities, and interactive Python simulations."

# Push to remote repository
git push origin main
```

## Alternative: Fix Git PATH in PowerShell

If you want to use Git in PowerShell, you need to add it to your PATH. Run this command in PowerShell (replace with actual Git installation path if different):

```powershell
$env:Path += ";C:\Program Files\Git\cmd"
```

Or permanently add Git to your system PATH:
1. Open System Properties > Environment Variables
2. Edit the "Path" variable  
3. Add: `C:\Program Files\Git\cmd`
4. Restart PowerShell

## Verify Installation Locations

To find where Git is installed, try these locations:
- `C:\Program Files\Git\`
- `C:\Program Files (x86)\Git\`
- `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\Git\`
