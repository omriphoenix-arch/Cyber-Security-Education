# üè´ IT Department Deployment Guide

## üåê **Network Requirements & Security Considerations**

### **Minimum System Requirements**
- **Python 3.12+** on teacher workstations
- **Web browsers** (Chrome, Firefox, Safari) for HTML components  
- **150MB disk space** per installation
- **Network access** for GitHub updates (optional)

### **Network Security Considerations**

#### **Safe for School Networks:**
‚úÖ **No external connections required** for core functionality  
‚úÖ **Self-contained platform** - works offline  
‚úÖ **No data collection** - all student data stays local  
‚úÖ **No administrator privileges** needed for basic use  

#### **Firewall & Network Settings:**
- **Outbound traffic**: Only needed for optional Python package updates
- **Ports required**: None (standalone application)  
- **External dependencies**: GitHub (optional updates only)
- **Student data**: All stored locally - no cloud services

### **Installation Options for Schools**

#### **Option 1: Individual Teacher Installation**
```bash
# On teacher's computer
git clone https://github.com/omriphoenix-arch/Cyber-Security-Education.git
cd Cyber-Security-Education/Advanced_Security_Platform
python setup.py
```

#### **Option 2: Lab/Classroom Deployment**  
```bash
# Deploy to shared network location
# Students access via network drive or local installations
```

#### **Option 3: Portable Installation**
```bash
# Package for USB drive deployment
# No installation required - run directly
```

### **Student Data & Privacy Compliance**

#### **FERPA Compliance:**
‚úÖ **Local storage only** - no external data transmission  
‚úÖ **Teacher-controlled** student information  
‚úÖ **Export capabilities** for grade integration  
‚úÖ **No cloud storage** dependencies  

#### **Data Handling:**
- **Gradebook data**: SQLite database (local)
- **Student progress**: JSON files (local)  
- **Export formats**: CSV, HTML (school system compatible)
- **Backup strategy**: Standard file backup procedures

### **Integration with School Systems**

#### **Student Information System (SIS) Integration:**
- **CSV export** compatible with major SIS platforms
- **Grade passback** via standard formats
- **Roster import** from school databases
- **Progress reporting** for administrators

#### **Google Classroom / Canvas Integration:**
- **Assignment creation** using provided lesson plans
- **Resource sharing** via platform link sharing
- **Progress tracking** through exported reports

### **Professional Development Support**

#### **Teacher Training Requirements:**
