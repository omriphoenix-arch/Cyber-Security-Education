# üè¶ Database Security Simulation

## üéØ **Interactive Ethical Hacking Experience**

This simulation provides a comprehensive, hands-on experience of both **defensive** and **offensive** cybersecurity perspectives through a realistic banking database scenario.

## üé≠ **Dual-Perspective Learning**

### üë§ **User Perspective (Defensive)**
Experience the system as a legitimate user and administrator:
- Navigate a secure banking interface
- Understand normal system operations
- See security features in action
- Appreciate the importance of proper authentication

### üïµÔ∏è **Hacker Perspective (Offensive)**
Learn how attackers think and operate:
- Discover vulnerability discovery techniques
- Understand SQL injection methodologies
- Experience database enumeration processes
- Learn privilege escalation strategies

## üìÅ **Files Included**

### `secure_bank_database.py`
**A realistic banking database system with comprehensive security features**

#### ‚úÖ **Security Features:**
- Advanced password hashing (PBKDF2 with salt)
- Session management with secure tokens
- Rate limiting and account lockout protection
- Comprehensive input validation (mostly...)
- Transaction logging and audit trails
- Admin privilege separation
- Security event monitoring

#### ‚ùå **The Critical Flaw:**
- **SQL Injection vulnerability** in the transaction search function
- Uses string concatenation instead of parameterized queries
- Allows attackers to bypass security and extract sensitive data

#### **Sample Accounts:**
```
User Accounts:
- Username: john_doe     | Password: SecurePass123!     | Balance: $15,420.50
- Username: jane_smith   | Password: MyPassword456!     | Balance: $8,734.25
- Username: mike_wilson  | Password: BankingSecure789!  | Balance: $125,000.00

Admin Account:
- Username: admin        | Password: AdminSecure2024!   | Full system access
```

### `hacker_simulation.py`
**Interactive ethical hacking simulation demonstrating attack methodologies**

#### **5-Phase Attack Progression:**

1. **üîç Reconnaissance**
   - Information gathering about the target
   - Network and application fingerprinting
   - Identifying potential attack vectors

2. **üïµÔ∏è Vulnerability Discovery**
   - Testing for common vulnerabilities
   - Identifying the SQL injection flaw
   - Confirming exploitability

3. **üóÇÔ∏è Database Enumeration**
   - Discovering database structure
   - Identifying tables and columns
   - Understanding data relationships

4. **üí∞ Data Extraction**
   - Extracting user credentials
   - Stealing financial information
   - Accessing transaction records

5. **üëë Privilege Escalation**
   - Attempting admin access
   - Creating backdoor accounts
   - Accessing security logs

## üöÄ **Quick Start Guide**

### **Step 1: Experience as a Legitimate User**
```bash
python secure_bank_database.py
```

**Try these scenarios:**
- Log in as different users and explore their accounts
- Use the search functionality with normal queries
- Try the admin interface to see elevated privileges
- Observe security features like rate limiting and session management

### **Step 2: Experience as an Ethical Hacker**
```bash
python hacker_simulation.py
```

**Choose your experience:**
- **Interactive Mode**: Control each phase of the attack manually
- **Automated Mode**: Watch a complete attack unfold automatically
- **Payload Analysis**: Study the actual SQL injection techniques

## üíâ **SQL Injection Vulnerability Explained**

### **The Vulnerable Code:**
```python
# DANGEROUS: String concatenation allows injection
query = f"""
    SELECT id, from_account, to_account, amount, transaction_type, 
           description, timestamp, reference_number
    FROM transactions 
    WHERE (from_account = '{account_number}' OR to_account = '{account_number}')
    AND (description LIKE '%{search_term}%' OR reference_number LIKE '%{search_term}%')
    ORDER BY timestamp DESC LIMIT 50
"""
```

### **Attack Payloads:**

#### **1. Authentication Bypass:**
```sql
admin' OR '1'='1' --
```

#### **2. Data Extraction:**
```sql
' UNION SELECT username,password_hash,email,1,2,3,4,5 FROM users --
```

#### **3. Schema Discovery:**
```sql
' UNION SELECT name,sql,1,2,3,4,5,6 FROM sqlite_master WHERE type='table' --
```

### **Secure Fix:**
```python
# SECURE: Parameterized queries prevent injection
cursor.execute("""
    SELECT id, from_account, to_account, amount, transaction_type, 
           description, timestamp, reference_number
    FROM transactions 
    WHERE (from_account = ? OR to_account = ?)
    AND (description LIKE ? OR reference_number LIKE ?)
    ORDER BY timestamp DESC LIMIT 50
""", (account_number, account_number, f'%{search_term}%', f'%{search_term}%'))
```
